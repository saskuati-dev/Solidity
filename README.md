💻 Solidity Learning Journey

A repository dedicated to my Solidity studies, the programming language for smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Here, you will find a collection of exercises and projects developed as I dive deeper into Web3, DeFi, and dApps concepts.
📚 Projects and Exercises

This repository contains a series of smart contracts, each one focused on a specific blockchain concept. Some of the projects include:

FundMe: A crowdfunding contract that uses a Chainlink oracle to verify the minimum donation value in USD.

Basic Exercises: Implementations of fundamental concepts such as view, pure, modifier, mapping, and state management.

The intention is for this repository to be a record of my progress and learning, showcasing the evolution of my skills as a Web3 developer.
🛠️ How to Use

To inspect or run the contracts, you can use the Remix IDE online development environment.

Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/saskuati-dev/Solidity.git

Open Remix and navigate to the "File Explorers" tab.

Click the "Upload" icon to load the .sol files from the repository.

Select the ^0.8.0 compiler version and, in the "Deploy" tab, use a test environment provider (such as Injected Provider - MetaMask for the Sepolia network).

Copy and paste the Chainlink oracle address into the constructor to deploy the contract.

Obtendo ETH de Teste:

Para testar os contratos na rede Sepolia, você precisará de ETH de teste. Você pode obter ETH de forma gratuita em um dos seguintes faucets:
